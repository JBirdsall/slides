## git

History is important to understand why it works like:

- created to enable development of Linux kernel
- very decentralized (and democratic)
- you can commit without being connected to the internet
- designed so that you have lots of control over your commits
- for our purposes: local copy and github copy

## git

- different model than dropbox
- not file model, but content model 
- matches RStudio project 
- can use git without github

## github
