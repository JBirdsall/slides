# Transforming data with dplyr

##

<center><img src="images/data_workflow.png" width="700px"/></center>

Inspired by Hadley Wickham

## Goals of this lab

At the end of the lab, students will be able to:

- compare and contrast data.frame and tbl (pronounced: "table")
- use the 5 basic verbs in `dplyr`: filter(), select(), arrange(), mutate(), summarise()
- use the group_by command in combination with summarise
- combine the 5 basic verbs using %>%
- use `dplyr` when there is missing data

# Motivating research question

- We are going to try to address without regression or statistical tests

## Getting set-up

Load data:
```{r load.data}
load(url("http://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/soc504_s2015/CrowdstormingDataJuly1st.RData"))
```

Load dplyr:
```{r load.dplyr}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
```

## Working with data.frame and tbl

First as a data.frame
```{r print.data.frame}
soccer.data[1:100, ]
```

## Working with data.frame and tbl

Next as a tbl ("table")
```{r data.frame.to.tbl}
tbl_df(soccer.data)
```

## Working with data.frame and tbl
Convert to tbl
```{r data.frame.to.tbl.convert}
soccer.data <- tbl_df(soccer.data)
```

## Data 

```{r preview.data}
select(soccer.data, player.short, games, red.cards, rater1, rater2, ref.num)
```

## Data 

```{r preview.data2}
select(soccer.data, player.short, games, red.cards, rater1, rater2, ref.num) %>%
  filter(player.short=="lionel-messi")
```

## Data structure summary

- Data is stored in a tbl
- One row for each player-referee pair
- "all soccer players (N = 2,053) playing in the first male divisions of England, Germany, France and Spain in the 2012-2013 season and all referees (N = 3,147) that these players played under in their professional career"
- Each column is a variable (note that they are different types)
- More detailed documentation: http://bit.ly/soccer_data_docs

# dplyr overview

## Main idea

simple operations that can be combined flexibly: think Legos!

## Basic dplyr principles

- data.frame in, data.frame out (this is consistent with the "tidy" philosophy)
- First argument is a data.frame 
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with data.frame
- Never modify in place: you need to save results
- Optimized for both cognitive time (clear syntax) and compuational time (written in C++)

# dplyr: The five verbs

## a simple data.frame

- These examples are all from [Hadley Wickham's talk at useR 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SGif63VW6E)

- Let's start with a simple data.frame

# filter()

## filter()

  width="600px"/></center>

## filter() 

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_filter2.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## filter() with soccer data {.build}

Create table with only the games from the Spanish League. Note that this does not change soccer.data

```{r}
filter(soccer.data, league.country=="Spain")
```

## filter() 

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_filter_logic.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>


## filter() with soccer data {.build}

Create table with players with one or more red cards.
```{r}
filter(soccer.data, red.cards > 0)
```

## filter() with soccer data {.build}

Create a table with players who played for FC Barcelona, Manchester United, or Real Madrid  
```{r}
filter(soccer.data, club %in%
         c("FC Barcelona", "Manchester United", "Real Madrid"))
```

## filter() with soccer data {.build}

How many player-referee pairs are there where there is no missing data for the player's skin color?
```{r}
filter(soccer.data, !is.na(rater1), !is.na(rater2))
```


# select()

## select() 

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_select1.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## select() 

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_select2.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## select() with soccer data {.build}

Return a copy of soccer.data with the columns related to wins, losses, and ties
```{r}
select(soccer.data, victories, ties, defeats)
```


## select() with soccer data {.build}

Return a copy of soccer.data that contains columns "games"" up to "red.cards". 
```{r}
select(soccer.data, games:red.cards)
```

## select() with soccer data {.build}

What is the most concise way to select: columns "player.short up"" to and including "goals"", columns "ref.num"" up to and including "se.exp".  
```{r}
select(soccer.data, -(yellow.cards:rater2))
```


## select() with soccer data {.build}

Return a copy of soccer.data that contains all variables related to the referees
```{r}
select(soccer.data, ref.num, ref.country, ref.country.alpha)
```

## select() helper functions

Also, lots of helper functions

- starts_with(x): names starts with x
- ends_with(x): names ends in x
- contains(x): selects all variables whose name contains x
- one_of("x", "y", "z"): selects variables provided in a character vector.
- see ?select

## select() with soccer data {.build}

Answer the previous question (return a copy of soccer.data that contains all variables related to the referees) using a helper function 
```{r}
select(soccer.data, contains("ref"))
```

## select() with soccer data {.build}

Or
```{r}
select(soccer.data, starts_with("ref"))
```


# arrange()

## arrange() 

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_arrange1.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## arrange() 

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_arrange2.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## arrange() with soccer data {.build}

Arrange according to height
```{r}
arrange(soccer.data, height)
```

## arrange() with soccer data {.build}

Arrange according to height and decreasing weight
```{r}
arrange(soccer.data, height, desc(weight)) 
```

# mutate()

## mutate() 

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_mutate1.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## mutate() 

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_mutate2.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## mutate() with soccer data {.build}

Add a new variable total.cards based on red and yellow cards received 
```{r}
mutate(soccer.data, total.cards = yellow.cards + red.cards)
```

## mutate() with soccer data {.build}

Add a new variable of the mean skin color rating (watch out for missing values!)
```{r}
no.missing <- filter(soccer.data, !(is.na(rater1)), !(is.na(rater2)))
mutate(no.missing, skin.color = (rater1 + rater2) / 2)  
```

# summarise()

## summarise()

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_summarise1.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## summarise()

How many red cards are in the dataset?
```{r}
  summarise(soccer.data, total.reds=sum(red.cards))
```

## summarise()

You can use functions that take vector, return number ("Aggregate functions").  Examples:

- sum()
- total()
- mean()
- max()
- n()
- n_distinct()

# summarise() + group_by [much better]

## summarise() + group_by

<center><img src="images/wickham_dplyr_2014_summarise_group_by1.jpg"
  width="600px"/></center>

## summarise() + group_by w/ soccer data {.build}

How many red cards are there in each league?
```{r}
by_league <- group_by(soccer.data, league.country)
summarise(by_league, total.red=sum(red.cards))
```

## summarise() + group_by w/ soccer data {.build}

How many red cards and how many games are there in each league?
```{r}
by_league <- group_by(soccer.data, league.country)
summarise(by_league, total.red=sum(red.cards), total.games=sum(games))
```

## summarise() + group_by w/ soccer data {.build}

How many players are there in the dataset?
```{r}
by_player <- group_by(soccer.data, player.short)
summarise(by_player, count=n_distinct(player.short))
```

## summarise() + group_by w/ soccer data {.build}

Maximum number of red cards by club?
```{r}
by_club <- group_by(soccer.data, club)
summarise(by_club, max.red = max(red.cards))
```

# pipes

## pipes

- the 5 verbs can be combined using a the pipe operator %>%
- as you will see, pipes turn out to be awesome!
- prononce %>% as *then*
- For example:
```{r eval=FALSE}
soccer.data %>% 
  group_by(player.short) %>%
  summarise(count=n_distinct(player.short))
```

## pipes with soccer data {.build}

Which English club had the greatest total number of victories? 

* A. Everton FC 
* B. Liverpool FC
* C. Manchester City
```{r}
soccer.data %>%
  group_by(club) %>%
  filter(league.country == "England") %>%
  summarise(total.victories = sum(victories)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total.victories))

```

## pipes with soccer data {.build}

Find the average height by each country
```{r}
soccer.data %>% 
  group_by(league.country) %>%
  summarise(country.height = mean(height, na.rm = T))
```

## pipes with soccer data { .smaller .build }

Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players?

```{r}
soccer.data %>%
  filter(!(is.na(rater1) | is.na(rater2))) %>%
  mutate(skin.color = (rater1 + rater2) / 2) %>%
  group_by(skin.color) %>% 
  summarise(total.reds = sum(red.cards), total.games = sum(games)) %>%
  mutate(red.rate=total.reds / total.games)
```


## pipes in general {.build}

- can use them everywhere, not just with dplyr
- x %>% f(y) -> f(x, y)
```{r}
c(1, 3, 5, NA) %>% mean(na.rm=TRUE)
```

## But wait there's more. . . 

dplyr() also has:

- support for databases backends
- sql-like join operations
- do() operator so you can use other functions
- rename()
- easy parallelization (probably coming soon)
