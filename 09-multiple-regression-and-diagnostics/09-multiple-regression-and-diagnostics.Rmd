After this class you will be able to 

- explain what is a regression line and what is a residual is words, equations, and pictures
- explain the relationship between a regression coefficient and a correlation coefficent in words, equations, and pictures
- compare and contrast extrapolation and interpolation
- compare and contrast outliers, leverage, and influence

Note that last class we did this with single predictor model and now we are going to do it with two predictor models.

##

To make things concrete, we will talk about the relationship between education, father's education, and income.

##

What is a regression line and what is a residual is words, equations, and pictures?

##

Here is some data from the GSS.

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
load("data/gss_2010_training.RData")
gss.training <- tbl_df(gss.training)
gss <- select(gss.training, income06_n, educ, maeduc, paeduc) %>%
  filter(!is.na(income06_n), !is.na(educ), !is.na(maeduc), !is.na(paeduc))
# NOTE: DROPPING MISSING DATA LIKE THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS
gss <- rename(gss, income = income06_n)
```

## 

```{r}
require(car)
require(rgl)
scatter3d(educ, paeduc, income)
```

require(car)
require(rgl)

## 

```{r echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(gss, aes(x=educ, y=income))
p + geom_jitter() + xlab("Years of education") + ylab("Income category") 
```
