## Goals

After this class, students will be able to:

- Describe the goals for this course 
- Explain why this course might be different from what they expected
- Summarize the expectations we have for them this semester

## Goals for this course (short-term)

By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

- Conduct, interpret, and communicate results from analysis using multiple regression (including dummy variables and interactions)
- Conduct, interpret, and communicate results from analysis using logistic regression (including dummy variables and interactions)
- Describe the relationship between multiple regression, logistic regression, and then generalized linear model
- Describe the challenges and opportunities for making causal claims from observational data
- Write clean, reusable, and reliable R code
- Feel empowered working with data

## Goals for this course (long-term)

After this course is over, you will be able to:

- Learn new statistics
- Learn new programing

## My goals

I want this course to be:

- modern
- active
- optimized for the long-term, not the short-term

## A note on tone

Regression is:

- the most powerful framework for learning about society
- the worst thing that ever happened to social science; leading us to ask boring questions that we canâ€™t really answer anyway and obsess about the wrong things

# Inspirations for this class

## Inspirations for this class

- data science
- MOOCs (massively open online courses)
- open and reproducible research

By the time you are on the job market, computers will be 10x faster than they are now.  The trick is ride this wave rather than getting crushed by it.

In a race against the machine you will lose.

## MOOCs

- use the great educational materials that exist
- curation vs creation
- contribute to the commons

## open and reproducible research

- you will be able to reproduce your own work
- you will be comfortable having your work seen by others
- we will use tools that available to everyone in the world

# tools

## tools

- R
- RStudio
- RMarkdown
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- tidyr
- magritrr
- git
- github

all either free or open-source (or both)

## tools

Better tools mean qualitatively different research, not just the same thing faster

Typewriter vs computer

# Expectations

## 

Three main things you have to do:
 
- prepare for class by reading
- do your weekly homeworks
- finish the replication project

## Homework

Homework will be due every Thursday at midnight (including this Thursday)

You will submit your homework in R Markdown.

## R Markdown vs. what you have done before

[Baumer et al (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1894)

R Markdown uses source - output paradigm (not WYSIWYG)

## What is R Markdown?

<img src="images/rmarkdown.png" width="700px">

[RStudio RMarkdown documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

How many of you read and write LaTeX? HTML?

## R Markdown

In case you want to learn more, note that this workflow also involves 

- [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/): "Elegant, flexible and fast dynamic report generation with R"
- [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/): "If you need to convert files from one markup format into another, pandoc is your swiss-army knife."

## R Markdown

Why R Markdown?

- enables automation
- relatively easy to learn
- gets you into a modern eco-system

# Course style

## This is what the course should feel like

## Collaboration

- Work together.
- Ask your questions on Piazza.
- Use stackoverflow.

But, absolutely positively **don't copy and paste your code**.

## 

What is the right mental model for this class?

- Burger King Model
- Medical Model

Metaphor due to Neil Postman (I think)

## Computing logistics

- How many have laptops? Mac, Windows, Linux?
- How many need accounts on Lotka?
- Collect up everyone's email adddess.
- Ask everyone to sign up for Piazza.

## Class logistics

- Sunday at midnight (or before): Homework posted to github
- Monday, 1:30 - 3:00 meet in Wallace 165
- Monday, 3:00 - 5:00 meet in Stokes Library Computer lab
- Wednesday, 1:30 - 3:00 meet in Wallace 165
- Thursday at midnight, submit homework through github

Because form follows function, the ratio of class time to lab time will vary from week-to-week

## Laptop policy

No laptops, unless we are in the computer lab

- slides will be avaiable
- hard to take notes on technical material on laptop
- creates "second-hand smoke"
- see Shirky: [Why I Just Asked My Students To Put Their Laptops Away](https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368)

## Reading

- You *must* read the assigned material *before* class
- I will *not* summarize the reading for you
- In class we will build on the readings

## Honest talk

- Some of you might not think you can learn this material
- Some of you might not want to learn this material
- Learning is hard; we will all struggle in this class
